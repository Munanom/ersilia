# ML for Drug Discovery

We have developed a 4-day training course on the applications of AI/ML to infectious disease drug discovery aimed at chemists and biologists who want to apply the insights of AI/ML models to their work.&#x20;

The course contents are divided as follows:

* Introduction to Drug Discovery and working with Chemistry data
* Introduction to ML basics and model outputs
* ADMET tools
* Open Science and generative models

Each block content is organised as a full day session, including keynote lectures, hands-on training and breakout sessions. If you cannot attend a live course, we recommend using the materials for self-learning. All relevant content and links, as well as extra materials, can be found in the [Event Fund](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/event-fund) webpage.
