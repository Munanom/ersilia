# External resources

## Join our Slack community

There is an enormous amount of resources to learn about **drug discovery**, **artificial intellicence & machine learning**, and **global health**.

We continuously screen the literature, social media and the web in search of relevant content related these areas of research. Feel free to join our Slack community (message us at [hello@ersilia.io](mailto:hello@ersilia.io) and we will send you an invitation link). In particular, you may be interested in the **#literature** and **#technology** and **#media** channels.

## Drug discovery materials

### Wellcome Centre Anti-Infectives Research (WCAIR)

The WCAIR in Dundee offers a set of free [online courses](https://wcair.dundee.ac.uk/training/training-resources/) to support drug discovery research. We highly recommend the following:

* [Medicinal Chemistry](https://wcair.dundee.ac.uk/training/training-resources/medchem/)
* [The Basics of DMPK](https://wcair.dundee.ac.uk/training/training-resources/basicsofdmpk/)
* [In Conversation](https://wcair.dundee.ac.uk/training/training-resources/in-conversation-with/)

### Literature reviews

To get started with AI/ML applied to drug discovery, you can read these two review articles published in [_Nature Reviews Drug Discovery_](https://www.nature.com/nrd/):

* [Schneider et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-019-0050-3). "Rethinking drug design in the artificial intelligence era"
* [Vamathevan et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-019-0024-5). "Applications of machine learning in drug discovery and development"
